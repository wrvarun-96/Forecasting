Predictive Analytics for Inventory Management
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast demand for various products, enabling businesses to optimize inventory levels and reduce instances of stockouts or overstock situations. The solution also predicts seasonal trends, assisting in better planning for peak sales periods.

Key Techniques
Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA, Prophet
Regression Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables to predict demand.
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, XGBoost
Datasets
Walmart Sales Forecasting Dataset: This dataset contains sales data across different stores and departments, making it ideal for inventory forecasting tasks.
Features
Demand Forecasting: Accurate predictions for product demand based on historical data.
Seasonality Analysis: Identifying seasonal trends to inform inventory planning.
Optimization: Helps minimize stockouts and reduce excess inventory.
Results
Improved inventory management by accurately predicting demand patterns.
Reduced costs associated with overstocking or understocking.
Enhanced decision-making for seasonal planning.
Repository Contents
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Model Development: Implementation of ARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, and other performance metrics to validate models.
Visualizations: Insights into seasonal trends and forecast accuracy through plots.
